# ruby-bot

A bot/chatterbot is computer program that can hold a conversation with us. Bots are present in a lot of different software and tools these days. The good thing about developing a bot is that it can be as simple or as complex as you like. 

This bot covers some good Ruby techniques.

The bot app includes testing and documentation, as well as using classes and complex data structures. It uses files to store information the bot uses, and looks at how to make the bot available to the general public using HTTP servers and CGI scripts. 

This app also demands lots of string and list-related functions, along with comparison logic. These are all things one is likely to use in a larger development project. As Ruby is a particularly good language for text processing, this app is perfect for demonstrating Rubyâ€™s strengths.
